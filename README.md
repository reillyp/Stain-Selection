# Stain-Selection
This program selects structures based on color/stain and size in a digital image of a tissue slide. It could also be used to select red tomatoes from a digital image of a garden, or blue stars from a digital image of a star field.
NOTE: The "dist" version of the program refered to in the program description which allows it to execute on PCs without Python is NOT included here due to the large size of the supporting files.
